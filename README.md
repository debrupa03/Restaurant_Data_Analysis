# Restaurant Data Analysis Project
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding key trends and dynamics within the restaurant industry. This project was completed as part of my Data Analyst Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**.

# Project Overview
In an increasingly competitive culinary landscape, data-driven insights are crucial for strategic decision-making. This project aims to extract actionable intelligence from a restaurant dataset, covering various aspects from customer preferences and geographical distribution to pricing strategies and the impact of online services.

# Key Areas of Analysis
The analysis is structured into several key areas, addressing critical questions about the restaurant sector:

* **Cuisine Trends:** Identification of most common cuisines and their market share.
* **City-wise Performance:** Analysis of restaurant distribution and average ratings across different cities.
* **Price Range Distribution:** Visualization and percentage breakdown of restaurant price categories.
* **Online Delivery & Table Booking:** Examination of service availability and its correlation with restaurant ratings and price ranges (including **Logit Regression Analysis**).
* **Restaurant Chains:** Identification and performance analysis of popular restaurant chains.
* **Customer Engagement:** Correlation between customer votes and aggregate restaurant ratings.
* **Geographical Patterns:** Plotting restaurant locations to identify clusters and regional concentrations.

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** The primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Pandas:** For efficient data handling and transformation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and creating insightful plots.
* **Statsmodels:** For statistical modeling, specifically Logit Regression.
